# Part 1 - data manipulation

1. Import and manipulate the anonymous_data.csv from the file directory above.
2. export the data into json format for visulisation in JavaScript 

If javaScript is your stronger language, feel free to use this to do so.

There is a main.py file which contains a series of steps to complete as noted below:


* step 1: create a function which reads a csv and transforms into a dataframe


* step 2: create a new dataframe which counts the number of times each emotion appears


* step 3: Export the new dataframe to a json file in the js_task folder to be used in part 2 - visualising

An example of the how the json data should look can be found in the js_task folder.
