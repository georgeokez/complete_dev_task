# Part 2 - data visualisation

1. Import all the data from the newly created json file from part 1 
2. Use vanilla js, React or any preffered means to visualise the data.

There are index.html & script.js files, however feel free to use which ever framework/packages you'd like

The data.json file in this folder shows an example of how the data should look after manipulation of the initial anonoymised csv. 


# Completed Task

The task was completed using react and host of third party libraries such as 
recharts for the charts and more.

### Note

The Python program was designed to persist the converted data into the folder path './js_task/src/data/' this is the location from which the Js App pulls data from.

### Running JS Application

To run app, run npm i in the terminal and then npm run start
