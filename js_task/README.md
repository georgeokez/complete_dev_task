# Part 2 - data visualisation

1. Import all the data from the newly created json file from part 1 
2. Use vanilla js, React or any preffered means to visualise the data.

There are index.html & script.js files, however feel free to use which ever framework/packages you'd like

The data.json file in this folder shows an example of how the data should look after manipulation of the initial anonoymised csv.
